# Research Session

## Initial Query

**Question:** Research FastMCP server configuration specifically. I need detailed information on: 1) How FastMCP servers are configured to run as HTTP/SSE servers instead of stdio, including command-line arguments and environment variables. 2) The correct way to expose FastMCP servers via Docker for external HTTP access on port 8080. 3) Authentication patterns for FastMCP - what API keys or tokens are required for remote access. 4) Specific examples of FastMCP docker-compose.yml configurations that work for external access. 5) How the `mcp.run()` method can be configured to listen on HTTP instead of stdio. 6) Any required security tokens or authentication that FastMCP needs for external connections.

**Response:**

FastMCP servers can be configured to run as HTTP/SSE servers (instead of stdio), exposed via Docker for external access, and secured with various authentication patterns. Below is a detailed, actionable guide covering each requested aspect, with code and configuration examples, edge cases, and best practices for your project context.

---

## 1. Configuring FastMCP as an HTTP/SSE Server (Not stdio)

**FastMCP** supports multiple transports: `stdio` (default), `http`/`httpStream` (for HTTP/SSE), and WebSocket. You can configure the transport using:

- **Command-line arguments**
- **Environment variables**
- **Configuration files (`fastmcp.json`)**

### Command-Line Arguments

- To run FastMCP as an HTTP/SSE server on port 8080:
  ```bash
  fastmcp run fastmcp.json --transport http --port 8080
  ```
  - `--transport http` or `--transport httpStream` switches from stdio to HTTP/SSE.
  - `--port 8080` sets the listening port, overriding any value in the config file[1][3].

### Environment Variables

- You can set environment variables to control the transport and port:
  ```bash
  export FASTMCP_SERVER_TRANSPORT=http
  export FASTMCP_SERVER_PORT=8080
  fastmcp run
  ```
  - Environment variables are prefixed with `FASTMCP_SERVER_`[4].

### Configuration File (`fastmcp.json`)

- Example minimal config:
  ```json
  {
    "$schema": "https://gofastmcp.com/public/schemas/fastmcp.json/v1.json",
    "source": {
      "path": "server.py",
      "entrypoint": "mcp"
    },
    "transport": "http",
    "port": 8080
  }
  ```
  - Command-line arguments override config file values[1][3].

### Programmatic (Python/TypeScript)

- **Python:**
  ```python
  from fastmcp import FastMCP

  mcp = FastMCP(
      name="ConfiguredServer",
      port=8080,  # HTTP/SSE port
      host="0.0.0.0",  # Listen on all interfaces for Docker
      log_level="DEBUG"
  )
  mcp.run(transport="http")  # Explicitly set transport
  ```
- **TypeScript:**
  ```typescript
  import { FastMCP } from "fastmcp";
  const server = new FastMCP({ name: "My Server" });
  server.start({
    transportType: "httpStream",
    httpStream: { port: 8080 }
  });
  ```
  - `transportType: "httpStream"` enables HTTP/SSE[2].

---

## 2. Exposing FastMCP via Docker for External HTTP Access (Port 8080)

### Dockerfile

- Ensure your Dockerfile exposes the correct port:
  ```dockerfile
  EXPOSE 8080
  ```

### docker-compose.yml Example

- Minimal working example:
  ```yaml
  version: '3.8'
  services:
    fastmcp:
      image: yourrepo/fastmcp:latest
      ports:
        - "8080:8080"
      environment:
        - FASTMCP_SERVER_TRANSPORT=http
        - FASTMCP_SERVER_PORT=8080
      restart: unless-stopped
      networks:
        - mcp-net

  networks:
    mcp-net:
      driver: bridge
  ```
  - This maps container port 8080 to host port 8080, making the HTTP/SSE server accessible externally[1][3].

### Edge Cases

- **Host Binding:** Ensure `host` is set to `0.0.0.0` (not `127.0.0.1`) so the server listens on all interfaces inside the container[4].
- **Port Collisions:** Only one service can bind to a given host port. Adjust as needed.

---

## 3. Authentication Patterns for FastMCP (API Keys, Tokens)

### Built-in Patterns

- **Header-based Authentication:** FastMCP allows you to capture and process HTTP headers for authentication.
- **Custom `authenticate` Handler:** Implement an `authenticate` function to validate tokens or API keys from headers[2].

#### Example (TypeScript)

```typescript
import { FastMCP } from "fastmcp";

const server = new FastMCP({
  name: "My Server",
  authenticate: async (request) => {
    const authHeader = request.headers["authorization"];
    if (!authHeader || authHeader !== "Bearer YOUR_SECRET_TOKEN") {
      throw new Error("Unauthorized");
    }
    return { user: "admin" };
  }
});

server.start({
  transportType: "httpStream",
  httpStream: { port: 8080 }
});
```
- This pattern enforces that all requests must include a valid `Authorization` header[2].

### Environment Variables for Secrets

- Store secrets as environment variables, e.g.:
  ```yaml
  environment:
    - FASTMCP_API_KEY=your_secret_key
  ```
- Reference these in your authentication logic.

### Passing Client-Supplied Keys

- You can allow clients to supply their own API keys via headers, storing them in the session for downstream use[2].

## 4. Example docker-compose.yml for External Access

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  fastmcp:
    image: yourrepo/fastmcp:latest
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    environment:
      - FASTMCP_SERVER_TRANSPORT=http
      - FASTMCP_SERVER_PORT=8080
      - FASTMCP_API_KEY=your_secret_key
    restart: unless-stopped
    networks:
      - mcp-net

networks:
  mcp-net:
    driver: bridge
```
- This setup is production-ready for exposing FastMCP on port 8080 with environment-based secrets[1][3][4].

---

## 5. Configuring `mcp.run()` to Listen on HTTP

- In Python, the `mcp.run()` method can be configured to use HTTP/SSE by passing the `transport` argument:
  ```python
  mcp.run(transport="http", port=8080, host="0.0.0.0")
  ```
- Alternatively, set environment variables or use a config file as described above[4].

---

## 6. Required Security Tokens or Authentication for External Connections

- **API Key or Bearer Token:** Implement header-based authentication using the `Authorization` header.
- **JWT Support:** For advanced scenarios, implement JWT validation in the `authenticate` handler.
- **Environment Variables:** Store secrets securely, never hardcode in code or Docker images.
- **HTTPS:** Always deploy behind a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx, Caddy, or Cloudflare Tunnel) to enforce HTTPS for public endpoints.
- **Zero Trust:** For highly sensitive deployments, use Cloudflare Zero Trust or similar to restrict access to authorized users only.

---

## Additional Security and Deployment Best Practices

- **Health Checks:** Enable a `/healthz` endpoint for liveness/readiness probes in Docker/Kubernetes[2].
- **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting in your authentication logic or via a reverse proxy.
- **Secrets Management:** Use Docker secrets or `.env` files for sensitive data.
- **Network Isolation:** Use Docker networks to restrict access between services.

## Actionable Steps for Your Project

- For **Task 29 (Deploy Redis MCP Server)**, use the above Docker and authentication patterns for FastMCP if you choose it as your MCP implementation.
- For **UI and integration tasks**, ensure your frontend and backend communicate with FastMCP over HTTP/SSE using the correct port and authentication headers.
- For **security**, always use environment variables for secrets, enforce HTTPS, and consider Zero Trust for public endpoints.
