# CHANGE TRACKING PROCESS
**Mandatory process for all system changes**

## üîÑ BEFORE MAKING ANY CHANGE

### 1. CHECK SYSTEM STATE DOCUMENTATION
- Read `SYSTEM_STATE_DOCUMENTATION.md` 
- Understand current database schema
- Check current API endpoint status
- Verify environment variable configuration
- Review existing page integrations

### 2. VERIFY CHANGE COMPATIBILITY
- Does this change fit with existing architecture?
- Will this break any current functionality?
- Are there dependencies that need updating?
- Is this change documented in TODO list?

### 3. PLAN CHANGE IMPLEMENTATION
- Document what will be changed
- Identify all affected files
- Plan testing approach
- Consider rollback strategy

## üîß DURING CHANGE IMPLEMENTATION

### 1. SMALL INCREMENTAL CHANGES
- Make small changes and test frequently
- Don't change multiple systems at once
- Test build after each significant change
- Commit working states frequently

### 2. DOCUMENTATION AS YOU GO
- Update comments in code
- Note any new dependencies
- Document any new environment variables
- Track any new database requirements

## ‚úÖ AFTER MAKING CHANGE

### 1. UPDATE SYSTEM STATE DOCUMENTATION
**MANDATORY:** Update `SYSTEM_STATE_DOCUMENTATION.md` with:
- New database tables or columns
- Changed API endpoints
- New environment variables
- Modified page integrations
- Updated dependencies

### 2. MOVE OLD INFO TO ARCHIVE
If something was removed or changed:
- Move old information to ARCHIVE section
- Explain why it was changed
- Document the new approach
- Keep archive for reference

### 3. TEST COMPLETE SYSTEM
- Test build locally
- Verify all integrations work
- Check database connections
- Test user flows end-to-end

### 4. COMMIT WITH DETAILED MESSAGE
```bash
git commit -m "Descriptive change summary

- Specific change 1
- Specific change 2  
- Updated system state documentation
- Tested: [list what was tested]"
```

## üìã CHANGE CATEGORIES

### üóÑÔ∏è Database Changes
- **Before:** Check DATABASE_SCHEMA_DOCUMENTATION.md
- **After:** Update both system state and database docs
- **Test:** Run /api/test-supabase to verify

### üåê API Changes
- **Before:** Check current endpoint status in system state
- **After:** Update API endpoint table with new status
- **Test:** Verify endpoint works and update response times

### üì± Page Changes
- **Before:** Check current page integration status
- **After:** Update page feature table
- **Test:** Verify all page functionality works

### üîß Environment Changes
- **Before:** Check current Vercel configuration
- **After:** Update environment variable table
- **Test:** Use test endpoints to verify

## üö® VIOLATION CONSEQUENCES

### If Change Tracking Process Not Followed:
1. **System state becomes unclear**
2. **Documentation gets outdated**
3. **Team loses understanding of system**
4. **Debugging becomes difficult**
5. **Changes break existing functionality**

### If Documentation Not Updated:
1. **Next changes made without context**
2. **Duplicate work on same problems**
3. **System complexity grows uncontrolled**
4. **Knowledge lost when team members change**

## ‚úÖ SUCCESS CRITERIA

### Good Change Process:
- ‚úÖ System state documentation updated
- ‚úÖ All tests pass
- ‚úÖ No functionality removed without reason
- ‚úÖ Clear commit messages
- ‚úÖ Archive section maintained

### Poor Change Process:
- ‚ùå Documentation not updated
- ‚ùå Changes break existing features
- ‚ùå No testing performed
- ‚ùå Unclear what was changed
- ‚ùå System state unclear

**This process ensures we maintain clear understanding of our hotel AI system as it grows in complexity.**
