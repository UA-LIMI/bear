Remove any `console.log` statements and replace them with Winston-based logging to maintain consistency and facilitate log aggregation.\n\n2. **Request Parsing Consolidation**: Confirm that only `express.json()` and `express.urlencoded()` are used for request parsing. Document this strategy and consider adding `express-validator` for input validation to enhance security.\n\n3. **Configuration Management**: Enforce a strict policy where all configuration is sourced from a centralized module (e.g., `src/config/env.js`). Use ESLint rules to prevent direct access to `process.env` elsewhere in the codebase.\n\n4. **Middleware Optimization**: Review middleware for redundancy and ensure that each middleware is modular and reusable. Remove any duplicate logging or error handling middleware.\n\n5. **Health Check Standardization**: Align health check endpoints (`/healthz`, `/readyz`, `/live`) with cloud-native standards by returning minimal, machine-readable responses. Use `/status` for detailed diagnostics intended for developers.\n\nThese strategies will improve maintainability, observability, and compatibility with industry standards and orchestration tools.\n</info added on 2025-09-15T21:28:33.577Z>",

For example, validate that API keys are non-empty strings, email fields match email format, and passwords meet complexity requirements. Sanitize inputs to prevent injection and normalize data (e.g., trim whitespace, normalize email case). Centralize error handling to return structured validation error responses (field-by-field details) in a consistent format. Ensure validation is applied before any business logic or external API calls. Document all validation rules and error responses for frontend integration. Example implementation for a registration endpoint:\n\n```js\napp.post('/register', [\n  body('name').notEmpty().trim().isLength({ min: 2, max: 50 }),\n  body('email').notEmpty().isEmail().normalizeEmail(),\n  body('password').notEmpty().isLength({ min: 8 })\n    .matches(/[A-Z]/).matches(/[0-9]/)\n], (req, res) => {\n  const errors = validationResult(req);\n  if (!errors.isEmpty()) {\n    return res.status(400).json({ errors: errors.array() });\n  }\n  // Proceed if validation passes\n});\n```\nExtend this pattern to all relevant endpoints, ensuring no user input bypasses validation.

Highlight differences between gpt-realtime and previous models, especially regarding direct speech-to-speech capabilities and latency improvements.\n<info added on 2025-09-15T22:11:50.917Z>\nSupported models for the OpenAI Realtime API currently include gpt-realtime and gpt-4-realtime (also referenced as gpt-4o-realtime-preview in some implementations)[1][2]. These models are designed specifically for low-latency, bidirectional audio streaming and real-time conversational interactions, distinguishing them from previous GPT models that primarily handled text-based, request-response patterns.\n\nConfiguration parameters for RealtimeAgent and RealtimeSession include the model name (e.g., model=\"gpt-4o-realtime-preview\"), API key, base URL, and optional settings such as verbose logging[2]. The API supports WebSocket as the primary transport for real-time audio and event streaming, with no direct mention of WebRTC in the current official integration patterns—WebRTC may be used in custom client-side audio handling but is not part of the core OpenAI Realtime API transport[1][2]. Key session configuration options include instructions for the agent, voice selection, audio transcription model, and turn detection (e.g., server-side voice activity detection)[3]. Additional parameters like temperature and reasoning.effort can be set to influence response creativity and processing depth, though their exact implementation may vary by SDK.\n\nInitialization typically involves creating a WebSocket connection to the OpenAI endpoint with authentication headers, then managing the session lifecycle for sending and receiving audio and events[2]. Below is a minimal Python example for agent instantiation and model switching:\n\n```python\nclass RealtimeApiConnection:\n    def __init__(self, base_uri, api_key=None, model=\"gpt-4o-realtime-preview\"):\n        self.url = f\"{base_uri}/v1/realtime?model={model}\"\n        self.api_key = api_key\n        self.websocket = None\n        self.session = aiohttp.ClientSession()\n\n    async def connect(self):\n        auth = aiohttp.BasicAuth(\"\", self.api_key) if self.api_key else None\n        headers = {\"OpenAI-Beta\": \"realtime=v1\"}\n        self.websocket = await self.session.ws_connect(self.url, auth=auth, headers=headers)\n\n    async def close(self):\n        if self.websocket:\n            await self.websocket.close()\n            self.websocket = None\n```\nTo switch models, update the model parameter in the connection URL during initialization[2].\n\nThe gpt-realtime and gpt-4-realtime models introduce direct speech-to-speech capabilities, enabling real-time audio input and output streaming over WebSocket, with the API managing conversation state, turn-taking, and interruptions seamlessly[1]. This is a significant departure from previous models, which required separate audio processing pipelines and suffered from higher end-to-end latency. The new models also support function calling in real time, with events for streaming function call arguments and completion, though the full function call must be assembled before execution[1]. Audio is transmitted as base64-encoded chunks, supporting uncompressed 16-bit, 24kHz audio (nominal bitrate ~384 kbps, ~500 kbps with base64 overhead, reduced with compression)[1]. The API handles phrase endpointing (turn detection) server-side, further reducing client complexity and latency compared to client-side solutions[1][3].\n\nIn summary, the OpenAI Realtime API and its supported models enable a new class of low-latency, voice-first applications with simplified integration, direct audio streaming, and improved conversational dynamics over previous text-centric GPT models.\n</info added on 2025-09-15T22:11:50.917Z>",
