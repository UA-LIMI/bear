# Research Session

## Initial Query

**Question:** Research comprehensive MCP server deployment and configuration patterns. I need to understand: 1) How MCP servers are properly configured for external access via Docker, including transport types (stdio vs HTTP/SSE vs WebSocket). 2) How Docker Hub and other platforms configure MCP servers for remote access - what are the standard patterns? 3) How developers typically connect Cursor to externally hosted MCP servers - what configuration examples exist? 4) What are the authentication and security patterns for remote MCP servers? 5) What are the differences between FastMCP, standard MCP, and other MCP server implementations in terms of connectivity? 6) Specific examples of docker-compose.yml files that properly expose MCP servers for external access. Focus on practical, working examples and official documentation.

**Response:**

MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers are typically deployed in Docker containers and configured for external access using a combination of transport types, environment variables, and security controls. Below is a comprehensive analysis of deployment and configuration patterns, with actionable examples and references to official documentation and real-world setups.

---

## 1. MCP Server Configuration for External Access via Docker

**Transport Types:**
- **stdio:** The MCP server communicates via standard input/output streams, ideal for local agentic tool integrations or when running as a subprocess[2][4].
- **HTTP/SSE:** The server exposes REST endpoints, often with Server-Sent Events for streaming responses. This is the most common pattern for remote access and integration with web clients or other services[1][3].
- **WebSocket:** Used for real-time, bidirectional communication, especially for voice, chat, or session-based AI applications. WebSocket endpoints are typically exposed on a public port and secured via TLS[1].

**Docker Configuration Patterns:**
- **Expose Ports:** Use the `ports` directive in `docker-compose.yml` or `-p` in `docker run` to map container ports to host ports for external access.
- **Environment Variables:** Pass API keys, tokens, and configuration options via `environment` or `--env-file`.
- **Restart Policy:** Set `restart: unless-stopped` for production reliability.
- **Network Isolation:** Use Docker networks to restrict access or enable inter-container communication.

**Example docker-compose.yml for HTTP/SSE:**
```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  mcp-server:
    image: ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server:latest
    ports:
      - "8080:8080" # Expose HTTP API
    environment:
      - GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_pat_token
    restart: unless-stopped
    networks:
      - mcp-net

networks:
  mcp-net:
    driver: bridge
```
This exposes the MCP server on port 8080 for external HTTP/SSE access, passing the required GitHub PAT as an environment variable[4].

**Example for stdio transport:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "docker-hub": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/FULL/PATH/TO/docker-hub-mcp-server/dist/index.js", "--transport=stdio"],
      "env": {
        "HUB_PAT_TOKEN": "YOUR_DOCKER_HUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
This configuration is used for agentic tools or local integrations, such as with VS Code or Qodo Gen[2][4].

---

## 2. Docker Hub and Other Platform Patterns for Remote MCP Access

**Docker Hub MCP Server:**
- **Configuration:** Typically run as a Node.js process with stdio transport for local integrations, or as an HTTP server for remote access.
- **Authentication:** Uses Docker Hub personal access tokens (PAT) passed via environment variables.
- **Standard Pattern:** The server is started with the required arguments and environment, and the client (e.g., Claude Desktop, VS Code) connects via the specified transport[2].

**Other Platforms (GitHub, Polar):**
- **GitHub MCP Server:** Runs in Docker, exposes HTTP or stdio, requires a GitHub PAT[4].
- **Polar MCP Server:** Uses Docker, authenticates via a Polar organization access token, and can be secured with Cloudflare Zero Trust for remote access[3].

**Typical docker-compose.yml for remote access:**
```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  polar-mcp:
    image: polar/mcp-server:latest
    ports:
      - "9000:9000"
    environment:
      - POLAR_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_polar_api_key
    restart: unless-stopped
```
This pattern is consistent across platforms: expose the API port, pass the required token, and set a restart policy[3][4].

## 3. Connecting Cursor to Externally Hosted MCP Servers

**Cursor Integration:**
- **Configuration File:** `.cursor/mcp.json` defines MCP servers and their connection parameters.
- **Transport:** Can be `stdio` for local/agentic tools or HTTP/WebSocket for remote servers.
- **Example:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "task-master-ai": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "--package=task-master-ai", "task-master-ai"],
      "env": {
        "OPENAI_API_KEY": "YOUR_OPENAI_KEY_HERE"
      }
    },
    "mqtt-lighting": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "ssh",
      "args": ["limi-vps", "docker", "exec", "-i", "coreflux-mcp-server", "python", "server.py"]
    }
  }
}
```
This allows Cursor to connect to both local and remote MCP servers, using SSH and Docker exec for remote stdio transport, or direct process invocation for local servers[2][4].

**Connecting to HTTP/SSE/WebSocket MCP Servers:**
- Update `.cursor/mcp.json` with the server's public endpoint and authentication credentials.
- Example for HTTP:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "remote-mcp": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://mcp.example.com/api",
      "env": {
        "API_KEY": "your_api_key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## 4. Authentication and Security Patterns for Remote MCP Servers

**Authentication:**
- **API Keys/Tokens:** Passed via environment variables (e.g., `GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN`, `POLAR_ACCESS_TOKEN`, `HUB_PAT_TOKEN`)[2][3][4].
- **OAuth/Personal Access Tokens:** Used for GitHub, Docker Hub, and other platforms.
- **Session Tokens:** For session-based authentication, often with expiration and refresh logic.

**Security Patterns:**
- **Cloudflare Zero Trust:** Protects public endpoints, enforces access policies, and provides session management[3].
- **TLS/HTTPS:** All public-facing MCP servers should use HTTPS for transport security.
- **Network Isolation:** Use Docker networks and firewall rules to restrict access.
- **Secrets Management:** Store secrets securely, avoid hardcoding in images, and use Docker secrets or environment files.

**Example: Securing MCP with Cloudflare Zero Trust**
- Configure Cloudflare to proxy and protect the MCP endpoint.
- Set access policies (email, domain, session duration).
- Enforce HTTPS and restrict access to authorized users[3].

## 5. FastMCP vs Standard MCP vs Other Implementations

| Implementation | Transport Types Supported | Performance | Security Features | Typical Use Case |
|----------------|--------------------------|-------------|-------------------|------------------|
| **Standard MCP** | stdio, HTTP/SSE, WebSocket | Moderate | Basic API key/token | General agentic tools, web APIs |
| **FastMCP** | HTTP/SSE, WebSocket (optimized) | High (low latency, high throughput) | Advanced (rate limiting, JWT, TLS) | Real-time AI, voice/chat, production APIs |
| **Platform MCP (GitHub, Docker Hub, Polar)** | stdio, HTTP/SSE | Platform-dependent | PAT/OAuth, platform-specific | Platform integrations, data access |

- **FastMCP** is designed for high-performance, real-time applications, often with built-in rate limiting, JWT authentication, and TLS by default.
- **Standard MCP** is more flexible, supporting multiple transports but may require additional configuration for security and performance.
- **Platform MCP servers** (e.g., GitHub, Docker Hub) are tailored for their respective APIs, with authentication and transport dictated by platform requirements[1][2][4].

## 6. Practical docker-compose.yml Examples

**Example 1: GitHub MCP Server (HTTP)**
```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  github-mcp:
    image: ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server:latest
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    environment:
      - GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_pat_token
    restart: unless-stopped
```
**Example 2: Polar MCP Server with Cloudflare Zero Trust**
```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  polar-mcp:
    image: polar/mcp-server:latest
    ports:
      - "9000:9000"
    environment:
      - POLAR_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_polar_api_key
    restart: unless-stopped
```
**Example 3: Docker Hub MCP Server (stdio)**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "docker-hub": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/FULL/PATH/TO/docker-hub-mcp-server/dist/index.js", "--transport=stdio", "--username=YOUR_DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME"],
      "env": {
        "HUB_PAT_TOKEN": "YOUR_DOCKER_HUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
**Example 4: Exposing MCP Server for WebSocket**
```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  fastmcp:
    image: fastmcp/server:latest
    ports:
      - "7000:7000"
    environment:
      - JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
      - ENABLE_WEBSOCKET=true
    restart: unless-stopped
```

---

## Edge Cases and Pitfalls

- **Token Expiry:** Ensure tokens (PAT, API keys) are rotated and refreshed as needed. Use short-lived tokens for production.
- **Port Collisions:** Avoid exposing multiple MCP servers on the same host port.
- **Network Security:** Never expose MCP servers directly to the public internet without TLS and access controls.
- **Secrets Leakage:** Use Docker secrets or environment files, never hardcode secrets in images or public repos.
- **Transport Mismatch:** Ensure client and server agree on transport type (stdio vs HTTP vs WebSocket).

---

## Actionable Steps for Your Project

- For **Task 29: Deploy Redis MCP Server**, use a docker-compose.yml similar to the above, exposing the required port and passing authentication via environment variables.
- For **Cursor integration**, update `.cursor/mcp.json` with the correct transport and endpoint for each MCP server.
- For **security**, consider using Cloudflare Zero Trust or similar to protect public endpoints, enforce HTTPS, and manage access policies.
- For **dynamic UI features** (Task 21, 22), ensure the backend MCP servers are reachable via HTTP/WebSocket for real-time guest management and session state.

**References:**  
- Docker MCP Gateway and Catalog documentation[1][2]  
- Speakeasy and Snyk guides for remote MCP server deployment and Docker patterns[3][4]  
- Project files: `.cursor/mcp.json`, `VPS_SETUP_GUIDE.md`, and docker-compose.yml examples

If you need tailored docker-compose.yml files or Cursor configuration for a specific MCP server (e.g., Redis MCP, FastMCP), please specify the server type and desired transport.
