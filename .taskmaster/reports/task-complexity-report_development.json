			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Backend Infrastructure Setup",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the backend infrastructure setup into subtasks covering project initialization, middleware configuration (CORS, request parsing, logging), environment variable management, health check endpoints, rate limiting, centralized error handling, secure logging, and API documentation.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves multiple foundational backend concerns, each with its own best practices and security implications. The breadth of required features (security, monitoring, error handling, documentation) and the need for robust, maintainable code increases both cyclomatic and cognitive complexity. Industry standards recommend modularizing each concern for clarity and testability."

		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Vercel AI Gateway Proxy Implementation",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the proxy implementation into subtasks for endpoint creation, SDK integration, API key management and rotation, request/response logging, multi-model support, error/retry logic, and authentication/authorization.",
			"reasoning": "Proxying AI requests securely requires careful handling of authentication, key management, logging, and error scenarios. Supporting multiple models and robust retry logic adds further complexity. Each aspect should be isolated for maintainability and compliance with secure coding standards."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "OpenAI Client Secret Generation Endpoint",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose the endpoint implementation into subtasks for endpoint creation, OpenAI API integration, token expiration/refresh logic, authentication, audit logging, and error/edge case handling.",
			"reasoning": "Generating ephemeral secrets securely involves integration with external APIs, token lifecycle management, and audit requirements. Each responsibility introduces decision points and error handling paths, warranting clear separation for reliability and security."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Frontend Voice Connection UI",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Split the UI development into subtasks for page setup, connection controls, status indicators, error feedback, microphone permission handling, and backend integration.",
			"reasoning": "While UI tasks are generally less complex than backend infrastructure, real-time status, error feedback, and permission handling introduce multiple states and user flows. Modularizing these concerns aligns with modern frontend best practices."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "WebRTC Voice Connection Logic",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the WebRTC logic into subtasks for client secret retrieval, SDK initialization, WebRTC setup, connection state management, reconnection logic, microphone setup, resource cleanup, and security validation.",
			"reasoning": "WebRTC integration for real-time voice is inherently complex due to asynchronous state management, reconnection, and resource cleanup. Security and cross-browser compatibility further increase the number of independent logic paths and required subtasks."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Frontend-Backend Integration & State Management",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down integration into subtasks for API client implementation, global state management, authentication flow, loading state handling, error handling/user feedback, and UI synchronization with backend events.",
			"reasoning": "Integrating frontend and backend with robust state and error management involves multiple asynchronous flows and user feedback scenarios. Industry standards recommend separating API, state, and UI concerns for maintainability and testability."
