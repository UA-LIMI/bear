# Cursor Rules Documentation

*Comprehensive rules for AI assistant behavior and development patterns*

## üìã **Core Rules**

### **General Development**
- **[self_improve.mdc](./self_improve.mdc)** - Continuous improvement and user collaboration patterns
- **[cursor_rules.mdc](./cursor_rules.mdc)** - Basic Cursor rule formatting and structure

### **Backend Development**
- **[backend_development.mdc](./backend_development.mdc)** - Node.js/Express patterns and standards
- **[ai_integration.mdc](./ai_integration.mdc)** - AI service integration security and patterns

### **Knowledge Management**
- **[knowledge_management.mdc](./knowledge_management.mdc)** - Research documentation and knowledge base patterns

## üìÅ **Task Master Rules**

### **Workflow and Process**
- **[taskmaster/dev_workflow.mdc](./taskmaster/dev_workflow.mdc)** - Complete Task Master development workflow
- **[taskmaster/taskmaster.mdc](./taskmaster/taskmaster.mdc)** - Task Master command reference and usage

### **AI Assistant Behavior**
- **[taskmaster/ai_decision_making.mdc](./taskmaster/ai_decision_making.mdc)** - AI decision-making patterns and research integration
- **[taskmaster/questioning_approach.mdc](./taskmaster/questioning_approach.mdc)** - Critical questioning to prevent over-engineering
- **[taskmaster/user_collaboration.mdc](./taskmaster/user_collaboration.mdc)** - Effective user collaboration patterns

### **Implementation Standards**
- **[taskmaster/implementation_standards.mdc](./taskmaster/implementation_standards.mdc)** - Code quality and architecture standards
- **[taskmaster/research_workflow.mdc](./taskmaster/research_workflow.mdc)** - Research-driven development approach

## üéØ **Key Principles Established**

### **1. Research-First Development**
- Always research before implementing complex technologies
- Create comprehensive knowledge bases
- Link code to research documentation
- Update research when patterns are insufficient

### **2. Question Complexity**
- Challenge assumptions about what needs to be built
- Ask "Do we already have this?" before building new functionality
- Prefer enhancement over replacement
- Listen to user feedback about over-engineering

### **3. Security and Standards**
- Never expose API keys to frontend
- Use ephemeral tokens for AI service communication
- Implement comprehensive input validation
- Follow industry security best practices

### **4. User Collaboration**
- Welcome user questioning of implementation approaches
- Adjust complexity based on user feedback
- Document successful collaboration patterns
- Maintain transparency about progress and decisions

### **5. Quality and Testing**
- Test implementations thoroughly
- Create both positive and negative test scenarios
- Document test results and lessons learned
- Implement monitoring and observability

## üß≠ **For Future AI Assistants**

### **Working Style Guidelines:**
1. **Start with research** for unfamiliar technologies
2. **Question complexity** when solutions seem elaborate
3. **Check existing solutions** before building new functionality
4. **Listen to user feedback** and adjust approach accordingly
5. **Document everything** for future reference

### **Implementation Approach:**
1. **Use Task Master actively** for organization and tracking
2. **Break down complex tasks** into manageable subtasks
3. **Research comprehensively** before starting implementation
4. **Test thoroughly** at each step
5. **Document lessons learned** for continuous improvement

### **User Interaction:**
1. **Explain what you're doing** in clear terms
2. **Ask for validation** when multiple approaches exist
3. **Welcome questioning** about complexity or necessity
4. **Adjust based on feedback** rather than defending initial approach
5. **Maintain transparency** about progress and challenges
