# Research Session

## Initial Query

**Question:** Save EMQX MCP Server usage patterns and examples. Document that successful publish_mqtt_message responses include message IDs (like "00062F55A1EFB1156ABC481240B30000"), while error responses show {"error": "..."}. Include the exact tool usage examples provided in the GitHub documentation showing how to properly use list_mqtt_clients, get_mqtt_client, kick_mqtt_client, and publish_mqtt_message tools.

**Response:**

The **EMQX MCP Server** provides a set of tools for managing MQTT clients and publishing messages programmatically, typically via an MCP-compatible agent or SDK. Below is a detailed overview of usage patterns, response formats, and exact tool usage examples as documented in the official GitHub repository and related documentation.

## EMQX MCP Server: Usage Patterns

### Core Capabilities

- **List MQTT clients**: View all connected clients, with filtering options.
- **Get client details**: Retrieve detailed information about a specific client.
- **Kick (disconnect) a client**: Forcefully disconnect a client by its ID.
- **Publish MQTT messages**: Send messages to any topic, with control over QoS and retention[1][2][3].

These tools are typically exposed as callable "tools" in the MCP protocol, allowing natural language agents or programmatic clients to invoke them.

---

## Response Formats

### Successful `publish_mqtt_message` Response

- **Includes a message ID** (e.g., `"00062F55A1EFB1156ABC481240B30000"`) and a confirmation message.
- **Example**:
  ```
  I've successfully published the poem to the topic '/poem' with QoS 1. The message has been delivered with ID: 00062F55A1EFB1156ABC481240B30000.
  ```
  This format confirms both the action and provides a unique identifier for the published message, which can be used for tracking or auditing[1].

### Error Response Format

- **Standardized as a JSON object** with an `"error"` key.
- **Example**:
  ```
  {"error": "error message"}
  ```
  This format is used for all tool errors, including invalid client IDs, connection issues, or publishing failures.

## Tool Usage Examples (from GitHub Documentation)

Below are the **exact usage patterns** for each tool, as described in the official documentation[3]:

### 1. `list_mqtt_clients`

**Purpose:** List all MQTT clients connected to the EMQX cluster.

**Example Usage:**
```plaintext
User: "List all MQTT clients currently connected."
Response: "There are 5 clients connected: client1, client2, client3, client4, client5."
```
- Supports filtering by node, username, client ID, and connection state.

### 2. `get_mqtt_client`

**Purpose:** Retrieve detailed information about a specific MQTT client by client ID.

**Example Usage:**
```plaintext
User: "Get details for client ID 'client1'."
Response: "Client 'client1' is connected from IP 192.168.1.10, subscribed to topics: /sensor/temp, /sensor/humidity, QoS: 1."
```
- Returns connection status, IP, subscriptions, QoS, and other metadata.

### 3. `kick_mqtt_client`

**Purpose:** Disconnect a client from the MQTT broker by client ID.

**Example Usage:**
```plaintext
User: "Disconnect client 'client2' from the broker."
Response: "Client 'client2' has been disconnected from the broker."
```
- On error (e.g., client not found): `{"error": "Client not found"}`

### 4. `publish_mqtt_message`

**Purpose:** Publish an MQTT message to a specified topic.

**Example Usage:**
```plaintext
User: "Please write a poem and send it to the topic '/poem' with QoS 1."
Response: "I've successfully published the poem to the topic '/poem' with QoS 1. The message has been delivered with ID: 00062F55A1EFB1156ABC481240B30000."
```
- On error (e.g., topic not found, broker unavailable): `{"error": "Failed to publish message"}`
- Supports specifying topic, payload, QoS (0, 1, 2), and message retention.

## Practical Integration and Use Cases

- **IoT Device Management**: List, monitor, and disconnect devices in real time.
- **AI-Driven Automation**: Use natural language agents to publish messages or orchestrate device actions.
- **Testing and Debugging**: Publish test payloads and monitor client states during development[1][2].

---

## Actionable Guidance for Your Project

- When integrating with the EMQX MCP Server (e.g., for WLED control or AI-driven automation), ensure your agent or backend handles both success and error response formats as described above.
- For **logging and auditing**, capture both the message IDs from successful publishes and the error objects for failed operations.
- When exposing these tools via your backend or UI, provide clear feedback to users, mirroring the confirmation and error patterns shown above.
- For advanced workflows (e.g., chaining database queries and MQTT publishes), use the message ID to correlate published data with upstream actions for traceability[1].
