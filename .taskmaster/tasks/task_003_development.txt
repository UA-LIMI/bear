# Task ID: 3
# Title: Vercel AI Gateway Proxy Implementation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement secure Express API endpoints for proxying text-based AI requests to Vercel AI Gateway, with auth, key management, logging, and multi-model support.
# Details:
Create /api/ai-proxy endpoint in Express. Integrate Vercel AI Gateway SDK for authentication and request forwarding. Securely store and rotate API keys in environment variables. Implement request/response logging for audit and debugging. Support multiple AI models via gateway configuration. Add error handling and retry logic for failed requests. Ensure all requests are authenticated and authorized before proxying.

# Test Strategy:
Unit and integration tests for proxy endpoint, including auth and error cases. Test key rotation and logging. Verify multi-model support through gateway configuration. Manual testing of request/response flow with real gateway. Automated monitoring for failed requests and retries.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Express API Endpoint Creation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the /api/ai-proxy endpoint in Express with proper routing, middleware setup, and request validation for handling AI proxy requests.
### Details:
Set up Express router for /api/ai-proxy endpoint. Implement request validation middleware to validate incoming AI requests (prompt, model, parameters). Add CORS configuration for frontend integration. Create request parsing logic for different content types. Implement basic endpoint structure with proper HTTP method handling (POST). Add request size limits and timeout configurations.

## 2. Vercel AI Gateway SDK Integration [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Integrate the @ai-sdk/gateway package for authentication and request forwarding to Vercel AI Gateway services.
### Details:
Install and configure @ai-sdk/gateway package. Implement gateway provider initialization with custom configuration. Set up generateText and other AI SDK functions for request forwarding. Configure gateway with proper base URL and API key handling. Implement request transformation from Express format to AI SDK format. Add response transformation back to Express-compatible format.

## 3. API Key Management and Rotation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement secure storage, retrieval, and rotation of Vercel AI Gateway API keys using environment variables and secure practices.
### Details:
Set up environment variable configuration for AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY. Implement secure key loading and validation on application startup. Create key rotation mechanism with graceful fallback. Add key health check functionality to verify API key validity. Implement encrypted storage for backup keys if needed. Add logging for key rotation events without exposing sensitive data.

## 4. Request and Response Logging System [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Implement comprehensive logging for all AI proxy requests and responses for audit trails and debugging purposes.
### Details:
Set up structured logging with appropriate log levels (info, warn, error). Implement request logging with sanitized data (no sensitive information). Add response logging with status codes and processing times. Create audit trail for all AI model interactions. Implement log rotation and retention policies. Add correlation IDs for request tracking. Include error logging with stack traces and context.

## 5. Multi-Model Support Configuration [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.2
### Description: Implement support for multiple AI models through gateway configuration, allowing dynamic model selection and routing.
### Details:
Create model configuration mapping for supported providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, xAI, Google, Meta, Mistral). Implement dynamic model selection based on request parameters. Add model validation to ensure requested models are available. Create model-specific parameter handling and transformation. Implement fallback logic for unavailable models. Add model usage tracking and statistics.

## 6. Error Handling and Retry Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.2, 3.4
### Description: Implement robust error handling and retry mechanisms for failed AI Gateway requests with exponential backoff and circuit breaker patterns.
### Details:
Implement exponential backoff retry logic for transient failures. Add circuit breaker pattern to prevent cascade failures. Create comprehensive error classification (network, API, validation errors). Implement timeout handling for long-running requests. Add rate limiting protection and queue management. Create detailed error responses with appropriate HTTP status codes. Implement retry limits and failure thresholds.

## 7. Authentication and Authorization [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Implement secure authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure only authorized requests are proxied to the AI Gateway.
### Details:
Implement JWT token validation middleware for request authentication. Add API key authentication as alternative auth method. Create user authorization checks before proxying requests. Implement rate limiting per authenticated user. Add request origin validation and CORS security. Create audit logging for authentication events. Implement session management and token refresh logic if needed.
