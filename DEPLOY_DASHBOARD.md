## 🔧 **Environment Variables for Vercel:**

### Required for Full Database Integration:
```env
# OpenAI (Already configured ✅)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key

# Supabase (Add these to Vercel)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=your_supabase_service_key
```

## 📋 **Next Steps:**

### Option 1: Deploy Now (Recommended)
1. **Test current dashboard** on Vercel with existing database
2. **Verify guest profiles** load from real data
3. **Test AI assistant** functionality
4. **Add missing tables later** for enhanced features

### Option 2: Complete Database First
1. **Run dashboard-extensions.sql** in Supabase SQL Editor
2. **Create missing tables** for staff, requests, menu, notifications
3. **Deploy complete system** with all features

---

## 🗄️ **Database Extensions (Optional)**

To enable all dashboard features, run this SQL in your Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Copy contents from: database/scripts/dashboard-extensions.sql
-- This creates: staff_profiles, guest_requests, menu_items, 
-- knowledge_base, notifications, room_status tables
```

## 🎯 **Modular Architecture Confirmed:**

✅ **Each component works independently:**
- Guest Profiles → Real database with fallback
- Room Control → Real database with fallback  
- Staff Management → Mock data (ready for database)
- Requests → Mock data (ready for database)
- Menu → Mock data (ready for database)
- AI Assistant → Vercel AI SDK (working)

**No component breaks if another fails - fully modular! 🎉**

## 🚀 **Deploy Command:**

The dashboard auto-deploys when you push to GitHub. Current status:
- ✅ Code pushed to main branch
- ✅ Vercel deployment triggered
- ✅ Build successful
- 🔄 Should be live shortly

**Ready to test your live dashboard!**
