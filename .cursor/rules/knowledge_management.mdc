- **Research Documentation Standards:**
  - **Create dedicated research directories** (.taskmaster/docs/research/) for comprehensive knowledge bases
  - **Document findings from multiple sources** in organized, searchable formats
  - **Include exact technical specifications** with API endpoints, formats, and examples
  - **Provide implementation templates** with research-backed code patterns
  - **Create troubleshooting guides** with error codes and resolution steps

- **Knowledge Base Organization:**
  - **Master Implementation Guide** - Consolidated technical specifications from all sources
  - **Code Templates** - Research-backed implementation patterns with references
  - **Quick Reference Guide** - Error codes, decision trees, and troubleshooting
  - **Source Documentation** - Detailed research from official documentation
  - **README Index** - Navigation guide for accessing appropriate documentation

- **Research-Code Integration:**
  - **Link code to research** via comments referencing specific documentation sections
  - **Include research references** in error messages for troubleshooting guidance
  - **Create debug information** that guides to relevant research documentation
  - **Map error codes to research sections** for quick problem resolution
  - **Provide implementation guidance** based on research findings

- **Knowledge Persistence Patterns:**
  - **Document implementation decisions** with reasoning and research backing
  - **Create reusable patterns** that can apply across projects
  - **Maintain research currency** by updating when new information becomes available
  - **Build reference systems** that guide future AI assistants and developers
  - **Preserve lessons learned** in accessible formats for team knowledge sharing

- **Research Update Triggers:**
  - **API responses don't match research** - may indicate outdated documentation
  - **Encountering undocumented patterns** - need additional research coverage
  - **New features or capabilities** - expand research to cover new areas
  - **Performance issues** - research optimization patterns and best practices
  - **Security concerns** - investigate current security recommendations

- **AI Assistant Knowledge Usage:**
  - **Check research files first** before making implementation decisions
  - **Reference specific research sections** when providing guidance
  - **Update research when insufficient** rather than making assumptions
  - **Guide users to research documentation** for complex technical decisions
  - **Validate implementations** against research findings before completion
