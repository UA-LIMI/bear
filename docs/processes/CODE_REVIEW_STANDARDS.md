# CODE REVIEW STANDARDS & QUALITY SCHEME
**Mandatory standards for Peninsula Hong Kong Hotel AI System**

## üéØ QUALITY STANDARDS

### ‚úÖ REQUIRED BEFORE ANY CODE CHANGE

#### 1. **Functionality Preservation**
- ‚úÖ Never remove working features
- ‚úÖ Enhance existing functionality, don't replace
- ‚úÖ Test that current features still work after changes
- ‚úÖ Maintain backward compatibility

#### 2. **Database Integration**
- ‚úÖ All data must come from database or external APIs
- ‚úÖ No hardcoded values (hotel names, room numbers, text labels)
- ‚úÖ Proper error handling for database failures
- ‚úÖ Fallback data only when external services fail

#### 3. **TypeScript Compliance**
- ‚úÖ All interfaces properly defined
- ‚úÖ No `any` types unless absolutely necessary
- ‚úÖ Proper error handling with typed exceptions
- ‚úÖ Build must pass without errors (warnings acceptable)

#### 4. **Performance Standards**
- ‚úÖ API calls optimized and cached when appropriate
- ‚úÖ Database queries efficient with proper indexes
- ‚úÖ UI responsive with loading states
- ‚úÖ No blocking operations in main thread

- [ ] Error states handled gracefully

## üö® COMMON REVIEW FAILURES

### ‚ùå Automatic Rejection Criteria:

#### 1. **Functionality Loss**
- Removing working features without replacement
- Breaking existing user flows
- Deleting functional code to fix warnings

#### 2. **Hardcoded Content**
- Hotel names, room numbers, or text labels in code
- Mock data that should come from database
- Fixed layouts that should be configurable

#### 3. **Poor Error Handling**
- No fallbacks when APIs fail
- Crashes when database unavailable
- No user feedback for error states

#### 4. **Documentation Failures**
- System state documentation not updated
- Database changes not documented
- No clear explanation of changes
