# Task ID: 7
# Title: Frontend-Backend Integration & State Management
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Integrate frontend with backend APIs, implement error handling, loading states, and connection status synchronization.
# Details:
Create API client in Next.js for backend communication (e.g., using axios or fetch). Implement global state management (e.g., Zustand or Context API) for connection status. Handle authentication flow if required. Show loading states during API calls. Implement robust error handling and user feedback. Synchronize UI with backend connection events.

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for API client and state management. Integration tests for end-to-end connection flow. Manual testing of error and loading states. Automated monitoring for API failures. Cross-browser testing.

# Subtasks:
## 1. API Client Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a centralized API client service in Next.js for backend communication with proper configuration, interceptors, and request/response handling.
### Details:
Set up axios or fetch-based API client with base URL configuration, request/response interceptors for authentication tokens, error handling, and timeout management. Create typed interfaces for API responses. Implement retry logic for failed requests. Configure environment-specific endpoints.

## 2. Global State Management Setup [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Implement global state management solution for connection status, user data, and application state using Zustand or Context API.
### Details:
Set up Zustand store or React Context for managing connection status, authentication state, and API loading states. Create typed state interfaces and actions. Implement state persistence for user preferences. Add state selectors and hooks for component consumption.

## 3. Authentication Flow Integration [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1, 7.2
### Description: Implement complete authentication flow with token management, automatic refresh, and secure storage.
### Details:
Create authentication service with login/logout functionality. Implement JWT token storage in httpOnly cookies or secure localStorage. Add automatic token refresh logic. Create protected route components and authentication guards. Handle authentication errors and redirects.

## 4. Loading States and UI Feedback [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.2
### Description: Implement comprehensive loading states, progress indicators, and user feedback components throughout the application.
### Details:
Create reusable loading components (spinners, skeletons, progress bars). Implement global loading state management. Add loading overlays for API calls. Create toast notifications for success/error feedback. Implement optimistic UI updates where appropriate.

## 5. Error Handling and User Feedback [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1, 7.2
### Description: Build robust error handling system with user-friendly error messages, retry mechanisms, and fallback UI components.
### Details:
Create centralized error handling service with error categorization. Implement user-friendly error messages and recovery suggestions. Add error boundaries for React components. Create retry mechanisms for failed API calls. Implement offline detection and appropriate UI feedback.

## 6. Backend Event Synchronization [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1, 7.2, 7.3
### Description: Implement real-time synchronization between frontend UI and backend connection events using WebSocket or Server-Sent Events.
### Details:
Set up WebSocket or SSE connection for real-time updates. Implement event listeners for connection status changes. Create UI components that react to backend events. Handle connection drops and reconnection logic. Implement heartbeat mechanism for connection health monitoring.
