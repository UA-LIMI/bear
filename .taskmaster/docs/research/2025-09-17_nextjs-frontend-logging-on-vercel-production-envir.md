# Research Session

## Initial Query

**Question:** Next.js frontend logging on Vercel production environment console.log visibility debugging production apps

**Response:**

**In Vercel production environments, `console.log` statements from Next.js server-side code (API routes, server components, middleware) are visible in the Vercel dashboard's Runtime Logs tab, but client-side `console.log` output is never captured by Vercel and is only visible in the user's browser console.** This distinction is crucial for debugging production apps and designing effective logging strategies for your Next.js frontend.

---

## Vercel Logging Overview

Vercel provides three main log types[2]:

- **Build logs:** Generated during deployment/build, accessible from the deployment tile.
- **Runtime logs:** Captured from serverless function invocations (API routes, server components, middleware), including all `console.log` output from server-side code[3].
- **Activity logs:** Track project-level events (not relevant for debugging app logic).

### Accessing Runtime Logs

- **Vercel Dashboard:** Navigate to your project, select a deployment, and open the "Runtime Logs" tab to view logs in real time[1][3].
- **Vercel CLI:** Use `vercel logs <deployment_url> -f` to stream logs, or `-n <number>` to fetch a specific number of log lines[2].

## Console Logging in Next.js on Vercel

### Server-Side Logging

- **API Routes & Middleware:** All `console.log`, `console.error`, etc., from server-side code are captured and shown in Vercel's Runtime Logs[3].
- **Server Components:** Logging works similarly, but be cautiousâ€”Vercel may redact error details in production to avoid leaking sensitive information[1].
- **Limitations:** Logs are not permanent and may be inconsistent; Vercel does not guarantee long-term retention[1].

### Client-Side Logging

- **Browser Console Only:** Any `console.log` in React components or client-side code is only visible in the end user's browser console. Vercel does not capture or display these logs[1][2][3].
- **Implication:** For debugging UI issues, you must rely on browser dev tools, remote error tracking, or custom telemetry.

## Debugging Production Apps: Strategies & Pitfalls

### Common Pitfalls

- **Missing Logs:** Developers often expect client-side logs to appear in Vercel, leading to confusion when debugging frontend issues[1].
- **Redacted Errors:** Vercel intentionally omits sensitive error details in production, making debugging harder without explicit logging[1].
- **Log Retention:** Vercel's runtime logs are ephemeral; for persistent history, you need third-party integration[1].

### Recommended Strategies

#### 1. **Centralized Logging for Server-Side Events**

- Use a logging library (e.g., **Winston**, **Pino**) to structure and forward logs from API routes and server components[1].
- Integrate with third-party services for persistent, searchable logs:
  - **Logtail:** Simple setup, good free tier.
  - **Axiom:** Deep Vercel integration.
  - **Sentry:** Error tracking and alerting.
  - **Datadog:** Enterprise-grade monitoring[1].

#### 2. **Client-Side Error Tracking**

- Integrate a browser-based error tracking service (e.g., **Sentry**, **LogRocket**) to capture client-side exceptions, user actions, and console output.
- Use custom telemetry to send critical client-side events to your backend for logging.

#### 3. **Structured Logging**

- Avoid logging sensitive data (e.g., stack traces, user info) in production logs[1].
- Use structured formats (JSON) for easier parsing and searching.

#### 4. **Debugging UI Issues**

- For issues with connection status, error feedback, or microphone permissions (as in your voice UI), add explicit error boundaries and user-facing error messages.
- Use browser dev tools for real-time inspection of client-side state and logs.

## Example: Winston Logger Integration (Server-Side)

```javascript
// logger.js
import winston from 'winston';

const isProduction = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production';

const logger = winston.createLogger({
  level: isProduction ? 'info' : 'debug',
  format: winston.format.combine(
    winston.format.timestamp(),
    isProduction ? winston.format.json() : winston.format.printf(({ level, message, timestamp, ...meta }) =>
      `${timestamp} ${level}: ${message} ${Object.keys(meta).length ? JSON.stringify(meta, null, 2) : ''}`
    )
  ),
  transports: [
    new winston.transports.Console({ stderrLevels: ['error'] }),
    // Add third-party transport here (e.g., Logtail, Sentry)
  ],
});

export default logger;
```
Use in API route:
```javascript
import logger from '@/logger';

export default async function handler(req, res) {
  logger.info('API called', { path: req.url });
  try {
    // ...logic
  } catch (error) {
    logger.error('API error', { error: error.message });
    res.status(500).json({ error: 'Internal Server Error' });
  }
}
```
This ensures all server-side logs are visible in Vercel and can be forwarded to external services[1].

## Applying to Your Project Tasks

### Task 5 & 7 (Frontend Voice UI & Integration)

- **Client-side logs:** Use browser console for debugging during development. For production, integrate Sentry or similar for error tracking and user feedback.
- **Server-side logs:** Ensure all API errors, connection events, and permission issues are logged using a centralized logger. Forward logs to a persistent service for post-mortem analysis.

### Task 19 (Testing & Assessment)

- **Log Review:** Use Vercel Runtime Logs for server-side issues. For client-side regressions, rely on browser console and error tracking tools.
- **Comparison:** If issues are found, compare logs from current and previous deployments using Vercel's dashboard and CLI.

### Task 20 (Audio Refactor)

- **Error Feedback:** Log all audio permission errors and recording failures server-side if possible. For client-side, surface errors to users and track with Sentry.

---

## Edge Cases & Advanced Considerations

- **Serverless Cold Starts:** Some logs may be missing due to serverless function cold starts or timeouts.
- **Sensitive Data:** Always sanitize logs in production to avoid leaking secrets or user data.
- **Log Volume:** Excessive logging can increase costs and clutter; use log levels (`info`, `warn`, `error`) judiciously.

## Summary Table: Logging Visibility in Vercel

| Code Location         | Vercel Runtime Logs | Browser Console | Third-Party Logging (e.g., Sentry) |
|----------------------|--------------------|-----------------|-------------------------------------|
| API Routes           | Yes                | No              | Yes (if integrated)                 |
| Server Components    | Yes                | No              | Yes (if integrated)                 |
| Middleware           | Yes                | No              | Yes (if integrated)                 |
| Client Components    | No                 | Yes             | Yes (if integrated)                 |

**Key Takeaway:**  
For debugging production Next.js apps on Vercel, rely on Vercel Runtime Logs for server-side code, and use browser-based error tracking for client-side issues. Integrate centralized logging for persistent, actionable insights, and always sanitize sensitive data in production logs[1][2][3].
