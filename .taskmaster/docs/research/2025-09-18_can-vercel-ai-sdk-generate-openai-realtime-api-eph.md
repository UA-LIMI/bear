# Research Session

## Initial Query

**Question:** Can Vercel AI SDK generate OpenAI Realtime API ephemeral client secrets directly without needing external VPS Docker backend? Research Vercel serverless functions for OpenAI ephemeral key generation vs current VPS proxy approach

**Response:**

Vercel AI SDK and Vercel serverless functions **cannot directly generate OpenAI Realtime API ephemeral client secrets or act as a secure relay for real-time WebSocket connections** without an external backend (such as a VPS or Docker server). This is due to architectural and security limitations inherent to serverless platforms and the requirements of the OpenAI Realtime API[4].

---

## Architectural Constraints: Vercel Serverless vs. VPS Proxy

### 1. **OpenAI Realtime API Requirements**
- The OpenAI Realtime API is built on **WebSockets**, enabling persistent, bidirectional communication for real-time streaming of text, audio, and multimodal data[4][3].
- **Authentication** for the Realtime API requires a secure server-side relay that holds the OpenAI API key. There is currently no client-side ephemeral secret mechanism provided by OpenAI for direct browser connections[4].

### 2. **Vercel Serverless Limitations**
- **Vercel serverless functions** (API routes) are designed for short-lived HTTP requests, not persistent WebSocket connections. They cannot maintain long-lived sessions required for real-time streaming[4].
- Serverless functions **cannot securely generate or distribute ephemeral OpenAI secrets** to clients, as this would expose sensitive credentials or require storing them in the frontend, which is insecure[4][1].
- Vercel does not provide built-in support for acting as a WebSocket relay or proxy for the OpenAI Realtime API. All real-time connections must be handled by a long-running backend process[4].

### 3. **Current VPS Proxy Approach**
- The recommended and secure architecture is to run a **dedicated Node.js relay server** (often on a VPS or Docker container) that:
  - Holds the OpenAI API key securely.
  - Manages WebSocket connections to the OpenAI Realtime API.
  - Proxies requests/responses between clients and OpenAI, handling authentication, logging, and session management[4].
- This relay can implement additional features such as **ephemeral session tokens**, request logging, and multi-model support, as described in your Task 3 requirements.

---

## Vercel AI SDK Capabilities

### 1. **Supported APIs**
- The Vercel AI SDK supports **OpenAI's REST APIs** (chat, completion, embeddings) and can be used with Vercel serverless functions for stateless HTTP requests[1][7][6].
- It does **not natively support OpenAI Realtime API WebSocket connections** or ephemeral secret generation for direct client use[3][4].

### 2. **AI Gateway Integration**
- Vercel AI Gateway provides an **OpenAI-compatible REST API** endpoint for HTTP-based AI requests, with authentication via API key or OIDC token[2].
- The Gateway does **not proxy WebSocket connections** for the Realtime API, nor does it generate ephemeral secrets for direct client access[2].

### 3. **SDK Extensibility**
- The SDK can be extended with provider-specific adapters, but as of now, **real-time streaming and session management for OpenAI Realtime API is not supported out-of-the-box**[3][5].
- Community discussions indicate interest in unified abstractions for real-time APIs, but these are not yet available in Vercel's SDK or serverless platform[3].

---

## Security and Ephemeral Key Generation

### 1. **Why Ephemeral Secrets Are Needed**
- Ephemeral secrets would allow clients to connect directly to OpenAI's Realtime API without exposing the master API key.
- OpenAI does **not currently provide a mechanism for generating short-lived, client-specific secrets** for the Realtime API. All connections must be authenticated via a server-side relay holding the API key[4].

### 2. **Serverless Function Limitations**
- Even if you attempted to generate ephemeral tokens in a Vercel serverless function, you would still need a persistent backend to manage session state and relay WebSocket traffic.
- Serverless functions are stateless and cannot maintain the required session lifecycle for real-time streaming.

---

## Actionable Recommendations for Your Project

### 1. **Continue Using a VPS/Docker Relay**
- For Task 3 (AI Gateway Proxy Implementation), maintain your current architecture: a secure Express.js backend running on a VPS or Docker container.
- This backend should:
  - Hold and rotate OpenAI API keys securely.
  - Proxy WebSocket connections for the Realtime API.
  - Implement authentication, logging, and multi-model support as described in your task context.

### 2. **Integrate Vercel AI SDK for REST APIs**
- Use Vercel AI SDK and serverless functions for stateless REST API calls (chat, completion, embeddings) where real-time streaming is not required[1][7].
- Store API keys in Vercel environment variables and never expose them to the frontend[1].

### 3. **Monitor SDK and Platform Updates**
- Track Vercel and OpenAI SDK releases for future support of real-time streaming and ephemeral secret generation.
- Community discussions suggest unified abstractions may be developed, but these are not yet available[3].

### 4. **Security Best Practices**
- Never expose OpenAI API keys or session tokens in client-side code.
- Use your backend relay to generate and manage any session tokens, ensuring they are short-lived and scoped to individual sessions.

## Example: Secure Realtime Proxy Architecture

```mermaid
graph TD
    Client -- HTTP/WebSocket --> Express Relay (VPS/Docker)
    Express Relay -- WebSocket --> OpenAI Realtime API
    Express Relay -- Auth, Logging, Key Rotation --> Internal Services
```

- **Express Relay**: Handles authentication, session management, and proxies real-time traffic.
- **Vercel Serverless**: Handles stateless REST API requests only.

---

## Edge Cases and Pitfalls

- **Attempting to use Vercel serverless for WebSockets** will result in dropped connections and unreliable session management.
- **Generating ephemeral secrets in serverless functions** is insecure and does not solve the relay requirement.
- **Direct client connections to OpenAI Realtime API** are not supported due to lack of client-side authentication and security risks.

## Conclusion

**You must use a persistent backend (VPS/Docker) to securely relay OpenAI Realtime API connections and manage ephemeral session tokens. Vercel AI SDK and serverless functions are suitable only for stateless REST API calls, not for real-time streaming or ephemeral secret generation for the Realtime API.**[1][2][3][4]
