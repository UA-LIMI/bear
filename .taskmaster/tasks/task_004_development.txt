# Task ID: 4
# Title: OpenAI Client Secret Generation Endpoint
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Build a secure API endpoint for generating ephemeral client secrets for OpenAI real-time voice, with token management, auth, and audit logging.
# Details:
Implement /api/generate-client-secret endpoint. Integrate with OpenAI's /v1/realtime/client_secrets to generate short-lived tokens. Configure token expiration and refresh logic. Secure endpoint with authentication (e.g., JWT or API key). Log all token generation events for audit. Handle errors and edge cases (e.g., OpenAI API downtime).

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for token generation and expiration logic. Integration tests with mocked OpenAI API. Verify auth and audit logging. Manual testing of token lifecycle and error handling. Automated monitoring for token generation failures.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create API Endpoint Structure [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement the basic /api/generate-client-secret endpoint with Express.js routing, request validation, and response formatting
### Details:
Set up Express route handler for POST /api/generate-client-secret. Implement request body validation for required parameters. Define response schema for successful token generation and error cases. Add middleware for CORS, body parsing, and basic request logging. Create endpoint documentation with OpenAPI/Swagger specifications.

## 2. OpenAI API Integration [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Integrate with OpenAI's /v1/realtime/client_secrets endpoint to generate ephemeral tokens
### Details:
Configure OpenAI SDK with organization API key. Implement service layer for calling /v1/realtime/client_secrets endpoint. Handle OpenAI API response parsing and token extraction. Add request timeout and retry logic for OpenAI API calls. Implement proper error mapping from OpenAI responses to client responses.

## 3. Token Lifecycle Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.2
### Description: Implement token expiration tracking, refresh logic, and cleanup mechanisms
### Details:
Create token storage mechanism (in-memory cache or Redis) for tracking active tokens. Implement token expiration validation and automatic cleanup. Build refresh logic for tokens nearing expiration. Add token revocation capability for security incidents. Create background job for expired token cleanup and metrics collection.

## 4. Authentication and Authorization [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Secure the endpoint with JWT or API key authentication and implement authorization checks
### Details:
Implement JWT token validation middleware for request authentication. Add API key authentication as alternative auth method. Create user/client authorization checks for token generation limits. Implement rate limiting per authenticated user/client. Add role-based access control for different token types or permissions.

## 5. Audit Logging System [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.2, 4.4
### Description: Implement comprehensive audit logging for all token generation events and security monitoring
### Details:
Create structured logging for all token generation requests and responses. Log authentication events, failures, and security violations. Implement audit trail with user identification, timestamps, and request metadata. Add log aggregation and monitoring alerts for suspicious activity. Create audit log retention and archival policies.

## 6. Error Handling and Edge Cases [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.2, 4.3
### Description: Implement robust error handling for OpenAI API downtime, network issues, and other edge cases
### Details:
Add circuit breaker pattern for OpenAI API failures. Implement graceful degradation when OpenAI service is unavailable. Handle network timeouts, connection errors, and malformed responses. Add health check endpoint for monitoring service status. Create fallback mechanisms and user-friendly error messages for all failure scenarios.
