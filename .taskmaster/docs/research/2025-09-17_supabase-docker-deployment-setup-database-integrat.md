## Overview of Supabase and Docker Integration

Supabase is an open-source Firebase alternative offering PostgreSQL database, authentication, real-time subscriptions, and storage—ideal for building a modern hotel management platform[2]. Docker simplifies deployment by containerizing all Supabase services (PostgreSQL, GoTrue for auth, Kong for API gateway, etc.), ensuring consistency across development, staging, and production environments[1][3].

**Why Docker?**  
Docker Compose orchestrates multiple containers (database, auth, API gateway, storage), making it easy to replicate the entire stack locally or in the cloud. This is critical for your hotel system, where data integrity, authentication, and real-time updates are paramount.

## Step-by-Step Supabase Docker Deployment

### Prerequisites

- **Docker** and **Docker Compose** installed on your host machine[1][3].
- **Git** for cloning the Supabase repository.
- Basic familiarity with terminal and environment variable management.

### Initial Setup

1. **Clone the Supabase Docker Setup**  
   ```bash
   git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/supabase/supabase
   cd supabase/docker
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   This gives you a ready-to-use Docker Compose configuration and a template for environment variables[1][3].

2. **Customize Environment Variables**  
   Edit `.env` to set your own secrets:
   - `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`: Strong password for the PostgreSQL superuser.
   - `JWT_SECRET`: Used by GoTrue and PostgREST for signing JWTs.
   - `ANON_KEY` and `SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`: Generate these using your `JWT_SECRET` (see Supabase docs for details).
   - `SITE_URL`: Base URL of your application (e.g., `http://localhost:3000` for local dev).
   - `SMTP_*`: Credentials for your email provider (needed for auth workflows).
   **Never deploy with default secrets**[1].

3. **Start Services**  
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```
   This launches all Supabase services in detached mode. Verify with `docker compose ps`—all services should show `running (healthy)`[3].

4. **Access Supabase Studio**  
   Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to access the Supabase dashboard, where you can manage your database schema, authentication, and storage[1].

## Database Schema Design for Hotel Guest Management

### Core Tables

- **guests**: Guest profiles (name, contact info, preferences, loyalty status).
- **rooms**: Room inventory (type, status, amenities).
- **bookings**: Reservation records (guest_id, room_id, check-in/out dates, status).
- **staff**: Hotel employees (roles, permissions).
- **payments**: Transaction history linked to bookings.
- **audit_logs**: For compliance and debugging (who did what and when).

### Example Schema (SQL)

```sql
CREATE TABLE guests (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  email TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  phone TEXT,
  preferences JSONB,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now()
);

CREATE TABLE rooms (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  number TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  type TEXT NOT NULL,
  status TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'available',
  amenities JSONB,
  rate NUMERIC NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE bookings (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  guest_id UUID REFERENCES guests(id),
  room_id UUID REFERENCES rooms(id),
  check_in DATE NOT NULL,
  check_out DATE NOT NULL,
  status TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'confirmed',
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now()
);
```

**Indexes**: Add indexes on frequently queried columns (e.g., `bookings.guest_id`, `bookings.room_id`, `bookings.status`).

**Row-Level Security (RLS)**: Enable RLS in Supabase to restrict access based on user role (guest, receptionist, manager)[1].

---

## Next.js Integration with Supabase

### Client-Side Setup

Install the Supabase JS client:
```bash
npm install @supabase/supabase-js
```

Initialize the client in your Next.js app (e.g., `lib/supabase.ts`):
```typescript
import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js';

const supabaseUrl = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL!;
const supabaseAnonKey = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY!;

export const supabase = createClient(supabaseUrl, supabaseAnonKey);
```

**Environment Variables**:  
Add `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` to your Next.js `.env.local` (matching the values in your Supabase `.env`).

### Example: Fetching Guest List

```typescript
import { supabase } from '../lib/supabase';

async function getGuests() {
  const { data, error } = await supabase.from('guests').select('*');
  if (error) throw error;
  return data;
}
```

### Authentication

Supabase provides built-in auth (email/password, OAuth, magic links). Use the `supabase.auth` methods for sign-up, login, and session management. For example, to implement a login form:

```typescript
async function signIn(email: string, password: string) {
  const { data, error } = await supabase.auth.signInWithPassword({ email, password });
  if (error) throw error;
  return data;
}
```

**User Roles**:  
Leverage Supabase’s JWT claims to implement role-based access control (RBAC) in your Next.js app and PostgreSQL RLS policies.

---

## Real-Time Features

Supabase’s real-time subscriptions are ideal for a hotel system, enabling live updates for room status, new bookings, and guest requests.

**Example: Subscribe to Room Status Changes**

```typescript
const subscription = supabase
  .channel('room-status')
  .on(
    'postgres_changes',
    { event: 'UPDATE', schema: 'public', table: 'rooms' },
    (payload) => {
      console.log('Room status changed:', payload.new);
      // Update UI in real time
    }
  )
  .subscribe();
```

## Security and Production Considerations

- **Secrets Management**: Never hardcode secrets. Use a secrets manager in production (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault)[1].
- **API Gateway**: Supabase uses Kong; ensure it’s properly configured with rate limiting and IP whitelisting if exposed to the internet.
- **Dashboard Security**: The Supabase Studio (dashboard) is not meant for public access. Restrict it via VPN, Basic Auth, or a private network[1].
- **Backups**: Regularly back up your PostgreSQL database. Supabase’s Docker setup includes pg_dump for this purpose.
- **Monitoring**: Integrate with Prometheus/Grafana or similar for monitoring database health, API usage, and error rates.

---

## CI/CD and Environment Parity

- **Development**: Use the same Docker Compose setup locally and in CI to ensure environment parity.
- **Staging/Production**: Consider deploying to a cloud provider (AWS, GCP, Azure) using Docker Swarm, Kubernetes, or managed containers (e.g., AWS Fargate)[1].
- **Migrations**: Use Supabase’s migration tools or plain SQL scripts to manage schema changes across environments.

---

## Edge Cases and Pitfalls

- **Database Growth**: Hotel systems can generate large volumes of data. Plan for partitioning, archiving, and efficient indexing.
- **Concurrency**: Handle booking conflicts (e.g., two users booking the same room) with transactional logic and optimistic locking.
- **Downtime**: Implement health checks, retries, and graceful degradation in your Next.js app.
- **Compliance**: Ensure GDPR/CCPA compliance for guest data. Use Supabase’s audit logging and data retention policies.

---

## Integration with Existing Project Tasks

- **Backend Infrastructure (Task 2)**: Your Express backend can use the Supabase JS client or direct PostgreSQL queries for complex business logic. Ensure all sensitive operations (e.g., payment processing) are handled server-side.
- **Vercel AI Gateway (Task 3)**: Keep AI-related data (e.g., voice session metadata) in Supabase, but proxy actual AI requests through your Express backend for security and logging.
- **UI System (Task 21)**: Design your Next.js UI to reflect real-time data from Supabase, with role-based views for guests, receptionists, and managers.
- **Audio/State (Tasks 19, 20)**: Store voice session metadata in Supabase, but handle actual audio streams client-side or via your backend as appropriate.

---

## Example: End-to-End Booking Flow

1. **Guest** logs in via Supabase auth.
2. **Guest** searches for available rooms (real-time query to Supabase).
3. **Guest** selects a room and submits booking (transactional insert into `bookings` table).
4. **Receptionist** sees the new booking in real time (Supabase subscription).
5. **Manager** reviews occupancy and revenue dashboards (aggregate queries).
